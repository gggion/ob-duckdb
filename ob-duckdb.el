;;; ob-duckdb.el --- Org Babel functions for DuckDB SQL -*- lexical-binding: t; -*-

;; Author: gggion
;; Maintainer: gggion
;; Version: 1.0.0
;; Package-Requires: ((emacs "28.1") (org "9.4"))
;; Keywords: languages, org, babel, duckdb, sql
;; URL: https://github.com/gggion/ob-duckdb.el

;;; Commentary:
;;
;; This package provides comprehensive Org Babel integration for DuckDB, an
;; in-process analytical SQL database. It enables executing DuckDB queries
;; directly in Org mode source blocks with robust support for DuckDB's
;; full feature set.
;;
;; DuckDB (https://duckdb.org/) is a high-performance analytical database
;; designed for in-process analytics that combines exceptional analytical
;; performance with a friendly SQL interface. This package brings DuckDB's
;; analytical capabilities directly into Org documents, enabling data
;; exploration, visualization, and documentation in a single environment.
;;
;; Key features include:
;;
;; - Execute DuckDB SQL queries directly in Org source blocks
;; - Format query results in various styles (table, box, markdown, JSON, etc.)
;; - Maintain persistent database connections through sessions
;; - Connect to database files or use in-memory databases
;; - Asynchronous query execution with :async yes header
;; - Variable substitution from Org mode elements into SQL queries
;; - Full support for DuckDB dot commands (.mode, .print, .shell, etc.)
;; - Custom header arguments for controlling query execution and formatting
;;
;; Basic usage example:
;;
;; #+begin_src duckdb
;;   SELECT * FROM generate_series(1, 5) AS s(num);
;; #+end_src
;;
;; Example with database connection and formatting:
;;
;; #+begin_src duckdb :db mydata.duckdb :format markdown :headers on
;;   SELECT * FROM mytable LIMIT 10;
;; #+end_src
;;
;; For asynchronous execution:
;;
;; #+begin_src duckdb :session mydb :async yes
;;   -- This runs in the background without blocking Emacs
;;   SELECT * FROM large_table WHERE complex_condition;
;; #+end_src

This should be the path to the DuckDB executable or simply \"duckdb\"
if it's in your PATH. You can also include command-line arguments
that should be used for all DuckDB executions.

The command is used as the basis for both direct command-line invocation
and for establishing interactive sessions. Any arguments included here
will be applied to all DuckDB processes created by this package."

This buffer is used when the :output header argument is set to \"buffer\".

for exploring data or debugging queries."

This prompt is used to identify the DuckDB prompt in the output buffer.
It should be a unique character or string that won't appear in your
actual query results, as ALL instances of this character will be
removed from the final output.

Examples of good prompt characters:
- \"🦆\"  (default)
- \"⬤➤\"
- \"⬤◗\"
- \"D>\"

CAUTION: Avoid using characters or symbols that might appear in your data

This is a critical communication bridge between the registration phase

the block ID and execution ID that uniquely identify the current block

results back to the originating block.

The variable is set by advice on `org-duckdb-blocks-register-execution'
and consumed during execution.")

This removes sessions whose processes or buffers no longer exist.

The function iterates through all registered sessions, checking if

This helps prevent resource leaks and maintain an accurate session list,

If a buffer for the named session already exists, return it.

Returns a buffer object dedicated to the named session.

The session system allows maintaining state between queries, including:
- Database connections
- Temporary tables

- Session settings and variables

Sessions are created on demand and persist until explicitly terminated
or until Emacs exits. Multiple sessions can exist simultaneously,
each with its own independent state and connection."

The transformation creates a virtual format that doesn't exist in DuckDB

is later post-processed to transform marked sections into proper Org tables.

The function identifies all occurrences of `.mode org-table` directives and:
1. Inserts an \"ORG_TABLE_FORMAT_START\" marker before the section

Post-processes the raw output from DuckDB to convert specially marked sections

directive implemented by `org-babel-duckdb-insert-org-table-markers`.

The function:
1. Searches for special marker strings:
   - (\"ORG_TABLE_FORMAT_START\" and \"ORG_TABLE_FORMAT_END\")
2. Leaves non-marked sections unchanged
3. Processes marked sections through `org-babel-duckdb-transform-table-section`
4. Reconstructs the output with properly formatted Org tables

This allows users to get native Org tables directly from DuckDB queries
without manual reformatting or additional post-processing steps.

Returns the transformed output with all marked sections converted to Org tables."
