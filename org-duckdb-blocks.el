;;; org-duckdb-blocks.el --- Track DuckDB block executions in Org files -*- lexical-binding: t; -*-

;; Author: gggion
;; Version: 1.0.0
;; Package-Requires: ((emacs "28.1") (org "9.5"))
;; Keywords: org, duckdb, data
;; URL: https://github.com/gggion/ob-duckdb

;;; Commentary:

;; The `org-duckdb-blocks' package provides a comprehensive tracking and
;; management system for DuckDB source blocks in Org mode documents.  It serves
;; as the foundation for execution history, block identification, and navigation
;; functionality in the `ob-duckdb' ecosystem.
;;
;; Key Features:
;;
;; - Persistent Block Identity: Assigns and maintains unique IDs for DuckDB
;;   source blocks across editing sessions using buffer-local properties
;;
;; - Execution History: Records each execution with timestamps, content
;;   snapshots, and parameter information
;;
;; - Position Tracking: Maintains up-to-date coordinates of blocks even as
;;   document content changes
;;
;; - Navigation Tools: Provides commands to revisit any previously executed
;;   block
;;
;; - State Preservation: Captures header arguments, switches, and content at
;;   execution time
;;
;; - Automatic Cleanup: Removes stale entries when blocks are deleted or moved
;;
;; This system was primarily designed to support asynchronous execution in
;; `ob-duckdb-async', allowing results to be correctly routed back to their
;; source blocks even after substantial document edits. However, it also
;; provides general-purpose execution tracking and navigation that's useful
;; independently.
;;
;; To use this package, simply require it from `ob-duckdb' or activate it
;; directly with:
;;
;;   (require 'org-duckdb-blocks)
;;   (org-duckdb-blocks-setup)
;;
;; Internally, the package maintains two primary data structures:
;;
;; 1. A registry mapping block IDs to their current positions and content
;; 2. An execution history mapping execution IDs to execution details
;;
;; Additionally, a circular buffer tracks recent executions for fast access and
;; navigation.
;;
;; The block tracking occurs automatically via advice on `org-babel-execute-src-block',
;; capturing information whenever a DuckDB block is executed.

;; --- ID normalization utility -----------------------------
(defun org-duckdb-blocks-normalize-id (id)
  "Return ID as plain string without any text properties.
This is critical for consistent hashtable lookups since text properties
can cause string equality comparisons to fail even when the visible
content is identical. All IDs in the system should be normalized
with this function before storage or comparison."

;;; Core Data Structures

(defvar org-duckdb-blocks-registry (make-hash-table :test 'equal)
  "Registry mapping block IDs to metadata.
The registry is the primary data structure tracking all known DuckDB blocks.
Each entry maps a block ID (string) to a property list with:

`:begin'     - Position of block beginning
`:end'       - Position of block end
`:file'      - File containing the block
`:buffer'    - Buffer name containing the block
`:content'   - Current block content (SQL text)")

(defvar org-duckdb-blocks-executions (make-hash-table :test 'equal)
  "Execution history mapping execution IDs to details.
Maintains the complete history of all DuckDB block executions.
Each entry maps an execution ID (string) to a property list with:

`:block-id'    - ID of the source block executed
`:begin'       - Block position at execution time
`:time'        - Timestamp of execution
`:content'     - Content executed (snapshot)
`:parameters'  - Header parameters used
`:header'      - Parsed header arguments
`:switches'    - Block switches applied
`:line-count'  - Number of lines in content
`:name'        - Name of the block (if any)")

(defvar org-duckdb-blocks-history-vector (make-vector 100 nil)
  "Circular buffer containing recent executions for fast access.
This data structure provides O(1) access to the most recent executions
without having to scan the full executions hash table. Each slot
contains a vector with [exec-id block-id timestamp] for quick rendering
of history lists and navigation controls.")

(defvar org-duckdb-blocks-history-index 0
  "Current position in the history vector's circular buffer.
Indicates where the next execution record will be written in
`org-duckdb-blocks-history-vector'.")

(defvar org-duckdb-blocks-history-count 0
  "Number of entries currently stored in the history vector.
Used to determine how many valid entries exist in the circular
buffer when retrieving recent history, especially before the buffer
has been completely filled.")

(defvar org-duckdb-blocks-history-capacity 100
  "Maximum number of recent executions to store in the history vector.
This limits the size of the circular buffer to prevent unbounded growth
while still providing convenient access to recent execution history.")
